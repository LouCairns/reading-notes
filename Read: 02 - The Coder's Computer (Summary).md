**Read Carefully**  
The following pages will give you a step by step introduction to using a terminal.  
While it refers to Linux, the same commands are available in macOS and Windows (with WSL).  
Read through these pages carefully.  
**Donâ€™t worry about trying this out on your own system yet, that will come very soon.**  
For now, take notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to how you are used to using the GUI File Explorer/Finder.
