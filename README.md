### 1. Intro to Lou

Find my Repo [HERE](https://github.com/LouCairns?tab=repositories)


I have previously worked as a Project Manager in transport, construction and business change. There is not a lot of my kind of project work in Peterborough, where I now live, so am looking to add some more strings to my bow. Hopefully this course will lead to a career change that will be more flexible around my young family.

Outside of work I enjoy:
- DIY (I am renovating my house by myself so am learning lots of new skills!)
- Re-finishing furniture (Keeps the costs down when living in a reno!)
- Trawling charity shops
- Cooking and eating lovely food!

This is a pic of me pre-children. **Eyebrows were illegal** and I lived on diet coke & marlborough lights...

### 2. Growth Mindset Overview

A growth mindset is a belief that intelligence and abilities can be improved with effort, education, and learning. 

People with a growth mindset face challenges and setbacks with resilience, passion, and constructive criticism. 

They think that their brain can evolve and respond to experiences over time. 

This is different from a fixed mindset, which assumes that intelligence and talent are not changeable

>Growth is painful.  
>Change is Painful.  
>But nothing is as painful as staying somewhere you don't belong.

### 2. Growth Mindset Reminders

1. Always believe that something *wonderful* it about to happen.  
2. Stop waiting to live.  
3. Be the BEST version of yourself.
