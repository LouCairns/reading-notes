### 1. Intro to Lou

Find my Repo [HERE](https://github.com/LouCairns?tab=repositories)


I have previously worked as a Project Manager in transport, construction and business change. There is not a lot of my kind of project work in Peterborough, where I now live, so am looking to add some more strings to my bow. Hopefully this course will lead to a career change that will be more flexible around my young family.

Outside of work I enjoy:
- DIY (I am renovating my house by myself so am learning lots of new skills!)
- Re-finishing furniture (Keeps the costs down when living in a reno!)
- Trawling charity shops
- Cooking and eating lovely food!
