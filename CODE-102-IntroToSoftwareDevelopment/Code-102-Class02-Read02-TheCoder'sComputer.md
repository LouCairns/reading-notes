### INSTRUCTIONS
***

**Read**  
- [Choosing a Text Editor](https://codefellows.github.io/code-102-guide/curriculum/class-02/Choosing-A-Text-Editor--The-Older-Coder.pdf)

**Read Carefully**  
The following pages will give you a step by step introduction to using a terminal.  
While it refers to Linux, the same commands are available in macOS and Windows (with WSL).  
Read through these pages carefully.  
**Donâ€™t worry about trying this out on your own system yet, that will come very soon.**  
For now, take notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to how you are used to using the GUI File Explorer/Finder.

### QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
***

### 1 - What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

1. code completion  
2. syntax highlighting   
3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)  
4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them  

### 2 - What do the following commands do?
- pwd  
    Print Working Directory. It tells you what your current or present working directory is.
    
- ls  
    To find out our current location
    
- cd  
    To change a directory.
    
- mkdir  
    To make a directory
    
- touch  
    The touch command is used to create, change and modify timestamps of a file
    
### 3 - Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line?
(Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

- cd projects  
    Would change my current working directory to "projects"
    
- mkdir new-project  
    Would create a new directory within "projects", called "new-project"
    
- touch new-project/newfile.md  
    Would create a new blank markdown file called "newfile.md" within the "new project" directory
    
- cd ..  
    Would change my current working directory to that one level above  
    
- ls projects/new-project  
    Would list the contents of the "new-project"  directory
